# Trivia Api

## Introduction
trivia api was created as a backend for the trivia project based on udacity course, it has endpoints to handle creation of questions and also returning random question for quizzes, it was designed using python flask following pep 8 guidelines.

## Getting Started
- BASE URL: the base url is still at localhost since its still in local development
    ```curl
    localhost:5000/
    ```

- API KEYS / AUTHENTICATION: there is currently no need for api keys to access the api.

## Error

this project handles errors and success by using the traditional http response codes

1.   ```2xx``` codes indicates successful responses

2. ```4xx``` codes indicates errors from client

below are the list of the codes return and their meaning

- ```200``` : this indicates that the request was succesful sample response provided below


- ```400```: this error occurs when the server will not process the request due to missing headers or data 

    

- ```404```: this error is returned when the question, category or route requested was not found

- ```405```: errors with this code occurs when the method used in the request was not accepted.

- ```406```: This error happens when a request is rejected due to missing or incorrect parameters.
